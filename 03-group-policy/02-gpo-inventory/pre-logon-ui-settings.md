### After applying GPO

![With GPO - Hero Image](../images/gpo-prelogon-ui-settings/after-hero-image.png)\
*Here we can see the hero image has been replaced with a plain system colour and our pre-logon message and title on Windows 10*

![With GPO - Hero Image](../images/Win11_PreLogon.png)\
*Here we can see the hero image has been replaced with a plain system colour and our pre-logon message and title on Windows 11*

![With GPO - Logon Screen](../images/gpo-prelogon-ui-settings/after-logon-screen.png)\
*And here we can see the removal of last logged-in user and the ability to change network pre-logon*

This is a much cleaner look and a very simple policy to apply.
